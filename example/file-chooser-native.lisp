;;;; File Chooser Native
;;;;
;;;; The <tt>gtk:file-chooser-native</tt> class is an abstraction of a dialog
;;;; suitable for use with "File Open" or "File Save as" commands. By default,
;;;; this just uses a <tt>gtk:file-chooser-dialog</tt> widget to implement the
;;;; actual dialog. However, on certain platforms, such as Windows and MacOS,
;;;; the native platform file chooser is used instead. When the application is
;;;; running in a sandboxed environment without direct filesystem access such as
;;;; Flatpak, the <tt>gtk:file-chooser-native</tt> object may call the proper
;;;; APIs (portals) to let the user choose a file and make it available to the
;;;; application.
